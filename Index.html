    <h1>ZARUQ ABDUL-MUQSIT</h1>
    <p>My name is ZARUQ ABDUL-MUQSIT. I have embarked on a journey in the tech world because it's a passion of mine to help people in my own little way. I joined the tech world while I was in secondary school, and it has been a really life-changing opportunity, but I haven't had enough time to do more projects or be more invested in it.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am a 300-level computer engineering student. I want to make very good use of my time to become better at backend development.</p>

    <h2>BACKEND DEVELOPER</h2>
    <p>Who is a developer? A developer is someone who creates, tests, and maintains software or applications to solve problems.</p>
    <p>Who is a backend developer? A backend developer specializes in server-side logic, database management, and ensuring the proper functioning of applications.</p>
    
    <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
    <p>The major problem I faced was working with terminal commands, and with the help of YouTube videos, I have tried to become better.</p>

    <h4>HNG INTERNSHIP</h4>
    <p>The main reason I am up for the internship is to get better ideas and more mentors to tutor me so I can be better than them and create user-friendly websites that help society.</p>

    <p>I thank HNG INTERNSHIP for this lovely opportunity and I also share with you guys the favor:</p>
